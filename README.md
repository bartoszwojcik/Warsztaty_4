# Book information REST-client website

1-day bootcamp workshop. A simple book-collection website, using REST (Ajax) to communicate with the server. 
The server (not available in the repository) was prepared using Django. The client website uses JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax.
The site itself is used to display information on books and add new ones using title, author, ISBN number, publisher, genre.
